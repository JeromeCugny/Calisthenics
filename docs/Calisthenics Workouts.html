              <p><strong>It wasn't that long ago that the word
                  "calisthenics" was completely foreign to the popular workout scene.</strong></p>
              <p>Back then, it was all about iron and brawn. If you did
                calisthenic exercises, you were thought to probably be in a cardio class. But times
                are much different now.</p>
              <p>Hop on over to YouTube and you'll see a ton of videos
                demonstrating some incredible feats of strength through calisthenic exercises alone
                such as One-Arm Pull-Ups, One-Legged Squats, Handstand Push-Ups, and other advanced
                exercises.</p>
              <p>Some of you might be wondering, "Jeff, what is a
                calisthenics workout?"</p>
              <p>I've got you covered. Here's a complete guide to
                calisthenics, including which exercises to do, how to do them, and a full calisthenics
                workout plan.</p>

              <h2 class="red-header"><strong>WHAT IS A CALISTHENIC WORKOUT?</strong></h2>
              <p><strong>Calisthenics refers to a form of exercise that
                  uses purely bodyweight as resistance. Yes, on the surface you're doing bodyweight
                  exercises, but there's more to it than that.</strong></p>
              <p>Unlike weight-based training exercises, where you have
                to get up to change or get extra weights or equipment, calisthenic exercises just
                require a simple change of angle to alter the intensity.</p>
              <p>For example, let's say you start with a Standard
                Push-Up, but you want to target your shoulders more. All you have to do is put your
                hips toward the ceiling and move into a Pike Push-Up position.</p>
              <div class="red-slashes text-body">
                A calisthenics workout consists of a series of bodyweight
                exercises that are performed in sequence. These exercises can be customized to suit
                your fitness level and individual goals, such as building muscle or increasing
                strength.
              </div>
              <p>Put a bunch of these exercises together and what do you
                have? A calisthenics workout</p>
              <p>Specifically, a calisthenics workout consists of a
                series of bodyweight exercises that are performed in sequence. These exercises can be customized to
                suit your fitness level and individual goals, such as building muscle or increasing
                strength.</p>
              <p>To really drive the point home, here are some common
                examples of calisthenics exercises that you are probably familiar with:</p>
              <ul class="redBullet">
                <li>Jumping Jacks</li>
                <li>Lunge</li>
                <li>Pull-Ups</li>
                <li>Chin-Ups</li>
                <li>Pistol Squats</li>
                <li>Regular Push-Ups</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h2 class="red-header"><strong>BENEFITS OF CALISTHENICS</strong></h2>
              <p><strong>If you've been lifting weights during your
                  fitness journey, you might be a bit skeptical about moving over to exercises that
                  only use body weight.</strong></p>
              <p>Here are some of the benefits of calisthenics training
                that'll make you a believer.</p>
              <h4 class="text-center"><strong class="header-small">TOTAL BODY
                  STRENGTH</strong></h4>
              <p>You don't need weights to get strong. Calisthenics
                exercises are just as effective at building total body strength. The trick is that you
                have to consistently challenge yourself by changing up the angle, stability, or number
                of arms and legs you're using.</p>
              <h4 class="text-center"><strong class="header-small">CONVENIENCE AND
                  FLEXIBILITY</strong></h4>
              <p>Another major benefit of calisthenics is that they can
                be done anywhere, anytime. Whether you're traveling or just don't have time to get to
                the gym, these exercises are perfect for fitting in a quick workout whenever and
                wherever you want.</p>
              <h4 class="text-center"><strong class="header-small">LOW IMPACT</strong>
              </h4>
              <p>If you're someone who is recovering from an injury or
                dealing with joint pain, calisthenics can be a great way to keep your fitness journey
                on track without putting additional stress on your body. Because these exercises use
                your own weight as resistance, they are gentle on the joints and easy for most people
                to do.</p>
              <h4 class="text-center"><strong class="header-small">IMPROVED
                  COORDINATION</strong></h4>
              <p>Performing complex movements like Squats or Burpees
                requires coordination between multiple muscle groups. Doing these exercises regularly
                can help you better coordinate your movements and improve your overall fitness
                performance.</p>
              <h4 class="text-center"><strong class="header-small">ENHANCED
                  MOBILITY</strong></h4>
              <p>Many calisthenics exercises, such as Push-Ups and
                Squats, require a full range of motion in order to be performed correctly. This can
                help increase your overall flexibility and mobility, which is especially important as
                you get older.</p>
              <h4 class="text-center"><strong class="header-small">TIME-EFFICIENT</strong></h4>
              <p>Calisthenics workouts can be done anywhere, which means
                you don't have to spend hours at the gym. In fact, you can get in a great workout in
                just 20-to-30 minutes!</p>

                <strong>5 TYPES OF CALISTHENICS</strong>
              </h2>
              <p>
                <strong>You're convinced that calisthenics can become an
                  important part of your workout routine, but you're not sure where to start.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>What type of calisthenic exercises should you focus on?
              </p>
              <p>It's important to look at a calisthenics workout plan as
                a total body workout.</p>
              <p>In other words, how can you arrange your workout in a
                way that hits everything and not just individual muscles with specific exercises for
                each like a traditional bodybuilding plan?</p>
              <p>The way to arrange your workouts is by focusing on
                hitting the five major functions for muscle groups:</p>
              <ul class="redBullet">
                <li>Lower Body Anterior Chain</li>
                <li>Upper Body Upper Push</li>
                <li>Lower Body Posterior Chain</li>
                <li>Upper Body Pull</li>
                <li>Abdominal Circuit</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

            <div>
              <h3>
                <strong class="red-header-small">LOWER BODY ANTERIOR CHAIN</strong>
              </h3>
              <p>When building a calisthenics workout, I'd recommend
                starting with the lower body and an anterior chain focus. In other words, start with
                the compound exercises that demand the most from the front of your lower body.</p>
              <p>In this case, you'll primarily be focusing on the
                quadriceps, which has four sections of muscle fibers:</p>
              <h4 class="text-center">
                <strong class="header-small">VASTUS

              <p>The Vastus Medialis is in the center of the quad,
                slightly on the inside of the knee. It helps with the extension of the knee.</p>
              <h4 class="text-center">

              <p>The Vastus Intermedius is also near the center of the
                quad, but it is beneath the muscle in the middle of the knee. Therefore, it can't be
                directly seen like the other parts. It is also involved in knee extension.</p>

                sync with the obliques on the opposite side to ensure rotation is possible during all
                those twisting exercises.</p>

                <strong>CAN YOU BUILD MUSCLE WITH JUST CALISTHENICS?</strong>
              </h2>
              <p>
                <strong>Yes! In fact, many people who use calisthenics
                  workouts do so specifically because they want to build muscle without lifting
                  weights.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>Naturally, this makes bodyweight workouts ideal for
                beginners, people who want to maintain what they've built so far, and people who want
                to focus on reconditioning.</p>
              <p>The real beauty of calisthenics exercises lies in the
                fact that the progressions and regressions of the movements are up to you. You can
                easily make them as beginner friendly or as challenging as you want.</p>
              <p>With that said, calisthenics exercises (as I'm going to
                show you) are just as effective for people who have been lifting for years and want to
                tap into more or different forms of muscle growth.</p>
              <p>Sure, you might need to use some advanced exercise
                variations, but you'd be surprised at the muscles you use during a Pull-Up compared to
                a Bent-Over Barbell Row.</p>
              <div class="red-slashes text-body">
                Calisthenics IS resistance training. The only difference is that your body is providing that resistance.
              </div>
              <p>Speaking of external weights, just because you're not
                holding a dumbbell or barbell doesn't mean that you're not engaging in an effective
                form of resistance training.</p>
              <p>Calisthenics IS resistance training. The only difference
                is that your body is providing that resistance.</p>
              <p>When done correctly, calisthenics can be an effective
                way to build muscle and strength. The key is to choose the right exercises for your
                goals, learn how to perform those exercises so that muscle mass is the end goal, and
                be consistent with your calisthenics workout routines.</p>
              <p>Naturally as you get stronger, you want to continue to
                challenge yourself by trying difficult progressions. The stronger you become, the more
                you should consistently and appropriately increase some form of variables such as
                intensity, duration, or frequency.</p>

                <strong>I'd say the hallmark of fundamental exercises is
                  that they can be used in any type of fitness routine.</strong>
              </p>
              <p>So, whether you're doing basic calisthenics exercises or
                advanced isometric exercises, if you can incorporate an exercise or a variation of
                that exercise into the workout, you know it's good.</p>
              <p>With that said, I have a list of calisthenics exercises
                that will be able to find a home no matter what your fitness goal is or what is on
                your workout calendar.</p>
              <p>What makes these calisthenic exercises great and not
                just another basic workout?</p>
              <p>Aside from being perfect complements for resistance
                training workouts, these awesome body weight exercises are designed to hit 2-3 times
                as many muscles as your typical isolation workout.</p>
              <p>They can also be regressed into beginner movements,
                allowing you to perfect the form and advance at your pace. Even if you only
                incorporate 2-3 exercises from this list into your program, I'm sure you'll see a big
                difference in your results.</p>
              <p>Best of all, you don't need any expensive equipment ÔÇô
                just your standard gym equipment of a pull-up bar.</p>
              <p>Here are my top 11 picks for the best bodyweight
                movements. We'll start with the big compound exercises for legs, back, and chest, then
                work our way around to the just as important support and stabilizer muscles and core
                muscles.</p>

              <p>Out first calisthenics exercise focuses on your legs,
                and while this is an easier exercise for beginners to start with, it will not
                compromise the gains that experienced lifters have built.</p>
              <p>Levitation Squats allow you to tap into the overload
                that is possible with single leg exercises, but without some of the negatives that
                might come along with Pistol Squats.</p>
              <p>For example, there is much less knee flexion, which
                allows for people that have meniscal issues to perform the exercise pain free.</p>

              <p>The focus here is to allow the glutes to drive the
                function of the hamstrings by contracting and stabilizing first. This will ensure that

              <p>Despite a lot of talk on YouTube, the Human Pullover or
                Human Flag exercise is NOT an ab exercise ÔÇô it's a back exercise.</p>
              <p>Specifically, the Human Pullover targets your lats from
                the top position to the bottom position, ensuring your able to overload the muscle.
                It's also a great way to improve upper body muscle endurance.</p>
              <p>Since you're utilizing your entire body weight and
                hitting the largest target muscle from the angle that matters, you'll see big gains in
                strength and muscle development.</p>
              <p>I must stress this: Do not curl your trunk up by using
                your abs. Instead, think of it like a Straight Arm Pushdown and mimic that to get your
                body up.</p>

                as muscle toning goes, the traditional Chin-Up can't be beat.</p>
              <p>One thing to keep in mind is that when you do the
                exercise, don't get too close to the bar. Maintain some distance between your straight
                body and the bar at the top.</p>

              <p>Now, let's switch to the other side of the upper body

                  href="https://athleanx.com/articles/how-to-do-pushups">Push-Ups</a>.
              </p>
              <p>This is one of the best overall exercises, especially
                for starting on a journey for muscle strength. Right from the get-go of the pushup
                position, this exercise taps into your pecs while demanding a lot from the core
                muscles, shoulders, and triceps.</p>
              <p>It's those last two inches of extension while doing the
                Push Up that matter if you want to get a complete chest contraction. Keep that in mind
                for all repetitions.</p>
              <p>But just as important is variation and challenging
                yourself. There are plenty of Push-Up variations outside of the Standard Push-Up
                including the following:</p>
              <ul class="redBullet">
                <li>Pike Push-Up</li>
                <li>Decline Push-Ups</li>
                <li>Uneven Push-Ups</li>
                <li>Plyometric Push-Ups</li>
              </ul>
              <p>The idea is that when you're great at one type of
                Push-Up, you should try to advance to another type that's a bit more challenging.</p>
              <p>For example, if you're able to do 15 Push-ups in
                standard form, then try something new in your next workout such as 20 Wide Push-ups or
                5 Clap Push-ups.</p>
              <p>That's what is so great about this exercise: There's so
                much variety.</p>

              <p>The Handstand Push-Up doesn't require any additional
                equipment, just a sturdy wall to balance yourself.</p>
              <p>The thing I love about this exercise is that it's one of
                the very few opportunities you have to do a shoulder exercise with an overhead

                exercise for the arms.</p>
              <p>Dips are a great chest, shoulder, and triceps builder.
                This is because you're suspending your entire body weight and you're not able to
                offload some of your own body weight like we do in the pushup.</p>

              <p>As far as what you need, this is another minimal
                equipment exercise. While a dip station would be preferable, you can also use the
                corner of a kitchen counter.</p>

              <strong>30-DAY CALISTHENICS WORKOUT PLAN </strong>
            </h2>
            <p>
              <strong>For this 30-day calisthenics workout plan,
                you'll receive TWO full-body workouts that you will alternate every other day.
              </strong>
            </p>
            <p>These are not your typical 3 day/week push-pull leg
              splits. Far from it!</p>
            <p>And these aren't just randomly chosen calisthenics
              exercises; each one has been selected to fit one of the major functions that I
              mentioned above:</p>
            <ul class="redBullet">
              <li>Lower Body Anterior Chain</li>
              <li>Upper Body Upper Push</li>
              <li>Lower Body Posterior Chain</li>
              <li>Upper Body Pull</li>
              <li>Abdominal Circuit</li>
              <li>Corrective Exercise</li>
            </ul>
            <p>In fact, I've laid out the exercises in this exact
              format to make it easier to understand.</p>
            <p>What's more, you'll find there is a both a beginner
              exercise module and advanced calisthenics workouts. Choose the route that works best
              for your current fitness level.</p>
            <p>
              <strong>Keep these rules in mind before you get
                started:</strong>
            </p>
            <ol class="redList">
              <li>There are no rest periods at any point during each workout, which is the reason we
                are staggering upper and lower body.</li>
              <li>You'll perform each exercise combination for ONE MINUTE with the goal of no rest.
              </li>
              <li>The exercises are staggered in such a way that it should allow you to continue to
                move through the workout even though you're fatigued from prior exercises. This
                gives you the chance to train to a point of progressive overload.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>You will alternate your "A" and "B" workouts. For
              example, if you start on Monday with the training session, you will alternate Monday,
              Wednesday, and Friday. Pick the days that work best for you to do three sessions per
              week.</p>

                Start on all fours with knees bent and feet touching the floor, palms flat on the

              <p>This one movement incorporates your lower back and
                glutes, which are two muscle groups that do their best when working together.</p>

                  <li>Calisthenics is a form of exercise that only uses your bodyweight as resistance.
                    With calisthenic exercises, instead of having to get up and add weight or change
                    equipment like you do with weight-based training, all you have to is adjust your
                    angle.</li>
                  <li>The benefits of calisthenics exercises include improved flexibility,
                    cardiovascular health, and coordination. They are low impact, time-efficient, and
                    cost-effective, making them a great choice for people at all fitness levels who want
                    to get stronger and build muscle without using weights or gym equipment.</li>
                  <li>If you're looking for an optimally designed calisthenics workout, you want to make
                    sure that it follows this movement pattern format: Lower Body Anterior Chain, Upper
                    Body Upper Push, Lower Body Posterior Chain, Upper Body Pull, Abdominal Circuit, and
                    Corrective.</li>
                  <li>Calisthenics, done with proper form and execution, is an excellent method for
                    gaining muscle and strength. Essential to this process are choosing the appropriate
                    exercises for your particular goals; learning the form of these movements so that
                    they result in increased muscle mass; and being consistent with your exercise
                    routines.</li>
                  <li>Most importantly, calisthenics exercises can be incorporated into any type of
                    workout calendar. No matter if you're doing bodyweight exercises or weight-based
                    resistance exercises, calisthenics can complement what you're doing now.</li>

                      <p>Calisthenics refers to a form of exercise that uses purely bodyweight as
                        resistance. A calisthenics workout consists of a series of bodyweight exercises
                        that are performed in sequence. These exercises can be customized to suit your
                        fitness level and individual goals, such as building muscle or increasing
                        strength.</p>

                        strong and build muscle. Calisthenic workouts are just as efficient at building
                        muscle and strength. However, instead of increasing the weight of your weights,
                        you will have to challenge yourself by changing up the angle, stability or
                        number of arms or legs you're using.</p>

                        order to grow. In particular if your calisthenic workouts are total body, it's
                        better to take a day off in between workouts and do calisthenic workouts 3-4
